I am Saket Harsh, a 3rd Year Undergraduate in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kanpur. I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand
I completed my class 12th from Delhi Public School , Ranchi in 2015.

I am a programming enthusiast(rather espoused) and am well versed with C, C++ and Python. Being so, I like  to solve algorithmic and mathematical problems in general. I am also quite inclined towards Open Source.

Apart from my academics , I like to play various sports ,listen to rock Music, and occassionaly blog about my experiences.



From what I know of myself, I can say that I am self driven. Once I decide I need to do a particular job, I dont need any further motivation to do so.  That is my biggest strength.

Well, for weakness, I think I am a bit impatient. I loose my cool sometimes, when the work is not done the way I wanted.


For a  person looking out for internships or jobs, I feel linkedIn is the best and by far the coolest web based solution that i know of. It continuously keeps on innovating itself , thus I would like to be a part of this company so that i can learn from the experiences that I gain there.
